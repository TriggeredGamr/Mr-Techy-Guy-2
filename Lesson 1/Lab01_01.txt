Debugging Problems

4. Line 6 there is no semicolon to end the command line. When the semicolon is typed at the end, the command should work.

5. Line 4 print in System.out.println is spelled incorrectly. It is spelled "prnntln" when it should be spelled "println".

6. Line 2 is missing a curly bracket at the end. If you add this curly bracket at the end it will run correctly.
