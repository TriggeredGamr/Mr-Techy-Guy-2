1. I researched and used /r /f /b and /'.

2. The output did not look like how I thought it would. All of the spacing is messed up. 

4. Line 6 there is no semicolon to end the command line. When the semicolon is typed at the end, the command should work.

5. Line 4 print in System.out.println is spelled incorrectly. It is spelled "prnntln" when it should be spelled "println".

6. Line 2 is missing a curly bracket at the end. If you add this curly bracket at the end it will run correctly.
