Issues In The Code:

1. Line 10 should have a curly bracket like this. "}"

2. Line 6 "print" is spelled "prnnt".

3. Line 8 there is no semicolon ending it.

4. Near the end of line 6 there is a "\|" when it should be "\\|"

5. Line 2 "arg" should be spelled "args"

6. Line 4 beginning inside of the quotes there is a "\ |" and it should be "\\ |"

7. Line 1 "challenges" should be spelled "challenge"
